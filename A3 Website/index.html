        <h2>ARARIPE MANAKIN</h2>

        <div class="container">

              <div class="text">ARARIPE BIRD</div>
            </div>
          </div>
          
        <p>
            The spectacular Araripe Manakin was only discovered in 1996. Like others in its family, including the 
            Pin-tailed and Club-winged Manakins, females and males look very different — the male is an eye-catching 
            white, red, and black with a forward-sweeping red crest, while the female is dull olive-green, with a small tuft 
            atop her head. The male's bright, helmet-like crown led to its Portuguese nickname soldadinho-do-araripe, 
            "Little Soldier of Araripe."<br><br>
            Other local nicknames for the Araripe Manakin hint at the bird's specialized and very limited habitat.<br><br>
            Local legend tells of a red-headed bird living by forest springs and streams at the foot of the Araripe Plateau 
            in northeastern Brazil. This bird, known as the galo de nascente (cock of the springs), must not be hunted, as it 
            is o dono do agua — owner of the waters. If this bird is hurt in any way, the story goes, the springs essential to 
            life in the surrounding dry lands will stop flowing.

        <h3>LEMUR</h3>

        <div class="container">
            <img src="Lemur Pic.png" alt="lemurpic" class="lemur" width="200%">
            <div class="overlay1">
              <div class="text">LEMUR</div>
            </div>
          </div>
          
        <p>
            Lemurs are a type of prosimian, which means they are primates that evolved 
            before monkeys and apes. They are more primitive than their cousins but share 
            certain characteristics. Found in only one area on Earth—Madagascar and the nearby 
            Comoro Islands—lemurs are considered the world’s most endangered group of mammals.<br><br>
            Today there are over 100 lemur species. Their lemur-like primate ancestor is thought 
            to have rafted over to Madagascar from Africa about 60 million years ago. With no 
            competition from other primates and little predation, the original lemurs evolved to 
            fill a large number of varying niches on the island.<br><br>
            If you did not know what a lemur was, you might guess that it was related to a cat, squirrel, 
            mouse, or dog. Lemurs are generally small in size, and their face somewhat resembles a mouse’s 
            face in smaller species or a fox’s face in larger species. Many lemur species have a snout, and 
            all have a wet and hairless nose with curved nostrils, which is unique among primates and makes 
            them superior sniffers. They have five digits on front and hind limbs, and some species have longer 
            hind limbs than forelimbs for jumping.<br><br>
            Their tail is not prehensile and varies in length, depending on the species. Lemurs range greatly in 
            size from the mouse lemurs to the indri. Lemurs have bright round eyes and soft fur that varies in color, 
            depending on the species. The most common lemur colors are white, gray, black, brown, and red-brown. 
            In some species, males and females have different coloring. For example, in blue-eyed black lemurs, 
            males are solid black and females are reddish-brown.<br><br>
            Lemurs that are diurnal (active during the daytime) ,are social and live in family groups or troops. 
            They follow the safety-in-numbers idea, using alarm calls when a predator is spotted to inform the rest 
            of the group. Nocturnal lemurs do not live in large groups, but have the cover of night to help protect 
            them. And, some lemurs are active day and night. The primary predator of lemurs is the fossa, although 
            they can fall prey to large boas, hawks, and introduced species, as well.<br><br>

        <h3>PANDA</h3>

        <div class="container">
            <img src="Panda Pic.png" alt="lemurpic" class="panda" width="200%">
            <div class="overlay2">
              <div class="text">PANDA</div>
            </div>
          </div>
          
        <p>
            The giant panda, a black-and-white bear, has a body typical of bears. It has black fur on its ears, eye 
            patches, muzzle, legs, and shoulders. The rest of the animal's coat is white. Although scientists do not 
            know why these unusual bears are black and white, some speculate that the bold coloring provides effective 
            camouflage. In patches of dense bamboo, an immobile giant panda is nearly invisible, and virtually disappears 
            among snow covered rocky outcrops on a mountain slope. This theory does not work, however, when considering that 
            giant pandas have no natural enemies to hide from. Another thought is that the pattern may accentuate social 
            signals in some way, or help giant pandas to identify one another from a distance so they can avoid socializing, 
            as they are typically a solitary animal. Another theory suggests that the black absorbs heat while the white reflects 
            it, helping giant pandas maintain an even temperature. Unfortunately, there is no one conclusive theory as to why giant 
            pandas are black and white.<br><br>
            The giant panda has lived in bamboo forests for several million years. It is a highly specialized animal, with unique 
            adaptations. The panda's thick, wooly coat keeps it warm in the cool forests of its habitat. Giant pandas have large molar 
            teeth and strong jaw muscles for crushing tough bamboo. Many people find these chunky, lumbering animals to be cute, but 
            giant pandas can be as dangerous as any other bear.<br><br>
            Giant pandas live in a few mountain ranges in south central China, in Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. They once lived 
            in lowland areas, but farming, forest clearing and other development now restrict giant pandas to the mountains.<br><br>
            Giant pandas live in broadleaf and coniferous forests with a dense understory of bamboo, at elevations between 5,000 and 
            10,000 feet. Torrential rains or dense mist throughout the year characterizes these forests, often shrouded in heavy clouds.<br><br>

      <h5>EBENACEAE</h5>
  
      <div class="container">

          <div class="overlay3">
            <div class="text">EBENACEAE TREE</div>
          </div>
        </div>
        
      <p>
          The Ebenaceae are a family of flowering plants belonging to order Ericales. The family includes ebony and persimmon 
          among about 768 species of trees and shrubs. It is distributed across the tropical and warmer temperate regions of 
          the world. It is most diverse in the rainforests of Malesia, India, tropical Africa and tropical America.<br><br>
          Many species are valued for their wood, particularly ebony, for fruit, and as ornamental plants.
          The fruits contain tannins, a plant defense against herbivory, so they are often avoided by animals when unripe. 
          The ripe fruits of many species are a food source for diverse animal taxa. The foliage is consumed by insects.
          The plants may have a strong scent. Some species have aromatic wood. They are important and conspicuous trees in many 
          of their native ecosystems, such as lowland dry forests of the former Maui Nui in Hawaii,[5] Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests, 
          Khathiar–Gir dry deciduous forests, Louisiade Archipelago rain forests, Madagascar lowland forests, Narmada Valley dry deciduous 
          forests, New Guinea mangroves, and South Western Ghats montane rain forests.<br><br>
          Ebony is a dense black wood taken from several species in the genus Diospyros, including Diospyros ebenum (Ceylon ebony, Indian ebony), 
          Diospyros crassiflora (West African ebony, Benin ebony), and Diospyros celebica (Makassar ebony). Diospyros tesselaria (Mauritius ebony) 
          was heavily exploited by the Dutch in the 17th century.<br><br>
          The family includes trees and shrubs. The leaves are usually alternately arranged, but some species have opposite or whorled leaves. 
          The inflorescence is usually a cyme of flowers, sometimes a raceme or a panicle, and some plants produce solitary flowers. Most species 
          are dioecious. The flower has 3 to 8 petals, which are joined at the bases. There are usually several single or paired stamens, which 
          are often attached to the inner wall of the corolla. Female flowers have up to 8 stigmas. The calyx is persistent. The fruits are 
          berry-like or capsular. Like the wood of some species, the roots and bark may be black in color.<br><br>

      Nelu flowers which bloom once in 12-14 years are now in full bloom and the most parts of the Horton Plains are covered with a white, pink 
      and purple carpet of Nelu flowers. A framed picture of the Nelu flower with a brief description is displayed at the Pattipola railway station. 
      The picture taken in 2001 by Yomal Perera of Hill Safari, gives a brief history of the life cycle of the plant and its blooming season and has 
      correctly predicted that the next blooming season would be between September-December, 2013.<br><br>
      The flower has been in bloom from the last week of September and may continue for another two weeks. There is limited time to experience this 
      wonder of nature. As Yomal Perera had explained, Thomas Farr, the builder of Farr Inn in the Horton Plains (the inn is no longer there) had found 
      that the Nelu or Strobilanthes plants flowered in 12-year cycles, in 1881, 1893, 1905 and when he left Sri Lanka in 1912 he had predicted that it 
      would next flower without fail in 1917 and 12-year cycles thereafter.<br><br>
      The flower bloomed in 2001 and if you miss this opportunity this year you will have to wait till 2024. According to botanists, Nelu also called Nilu 
      or Nilla, is a plant of the Strobilanthes family. There are around 130 Strobilanthes varieties in the world mainly in the Asia region. There are 31 
      species of Strobilanthes in Sri Lanka and of them 26 varieties are endemic to Sri Lanka.<br><br>
      In the Horton Plains you can find eight varieties and seven of them are endemic to the Horton Plains. Strobilanthes Pulcherrima, Strobilanthes Viscosa, 
      Strobilanthes Dianadra, Strobilanthes Hookeri, Strobilanthes Sexennies, Strobilanthes Calycina, Strobilanthes Nockii and Strobilanthes Anecps varieties 
      are found in the Horton Plains.<br><br>

    <p>
      Cassine orientalis is a large tree whose height generally varies between 5 and 10 meters, but some individuals can reach up to 20 meters high. The trunk 
      can reach 90 centimeters in diameter at its base, with long vertical slits all along. This species presents brief heterophylly; its juvenile leaves differ 
      from adults. The juvenile leaves are shiny, narrow with red midribs and a smooth rim, while the adult leaves are broad and oval with a serrated margin.<br><br>
      Bois d’olive is found at multiple elevations, in lowland, intermediate and upland forests. It has small inconspicuous hermaphrodite flowers, containing both 
      staminode and carpellate. The tree’s fruits are part of the diet of Pteropus niger, the Mauritius Flying Fox. Cassine orientalis is listed as ‘Vulnerable’ under 
      the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Historical deforestation and exploitation have reduced the tree’s population. The tree grows in a number of reserves and 
      is used for ecological restoration.<br><br>
      This species has been exploited for its red wood.The tree takes its name from its small fruit that looks like an olive, but it is not related to the olive tree of 
      Europe whose edible fruit has been consumed worldwide since ancient times.<br><br>
